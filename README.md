# PONG


The game Pong is a modified version of the game Mini Tennis from a game tutorial found in http://www.edu4java.com/en/game/game0-en.html.

This game is a simple hit-the-ball-and-score game. The player can choose either to play with another user or play with the computer. The goal is only to hit the ball with the racket. Everytime it hits the racket, the player earns a single point. The user can adjust the score limit and when playing with the computer the user can also choose a level of difficulty of the game whether easy, medium or hard. When the score limit is reached a dialog box will pop-up indicating that the game is over and another dialog box will appear asking the user if the game is to be restarted or just quit it.
